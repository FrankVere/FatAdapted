## Reflection

_What I enjoyed_

- Using the Spoonacular API and fetching/manipulating data
- Creating many different handlers and RESTful endpoints for data manipulation.
- Using conditional rendering throughout the project and linking them all together from different components.
- Learning and applying many different CSS styling techniques.
- Tackling bugs and resolving issues.

_Difficulties faced_

- Constructing the functionality of the Meal Plan component
- Connecting and getting the proper responses from the back-end to the front-end.
- Styling to ensure mobile responsiveness
- Managing many different API calls all at once

_Lessons learned_

- Learned to optimize our code to ensure easier accessibility across all developers
- Proper communication is necessary at every step, especially when modifying functionality.

## Next steps:

- Create a larger meal plan component
- Incorporate additional styling across our entire project
- Incorporate pagination into our Products page
